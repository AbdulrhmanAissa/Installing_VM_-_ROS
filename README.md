# Installing_VM_ROS

The first task that was required from us to do it in the summer internship with Smart Methods is to download the Virtual Machine and then download ROS on Ubuntu.

In the beginning i started by downloading the Virtual Machine. I chose to download VirtualBox version 6.1.34 from the link:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Next, it is required to download Ubuntu which i choose to use 20.04 since it worked better than the latest version which is 22.04. I have downloaded it from the link: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/

After making a new operating system on the virtual machine we choose the the Ubuntu disk file in the settings of the operating system that we have created before.
By following the steps on a youtube video that explained precisely how each step should be done the link of the video is: https://youtu.be/x5MhydijWmc

Now Ubuntu 20.4 is ready to be used. The next step that we need to do is to download ROS on Ubuntu which it operates better on Linux in comparison to Windows.

After that i started following the steps in the link: https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu to download ROS. I started by writing each command in the terminal one by one until i finished and the ROS started working properly.

Working on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS has been downloaded.
